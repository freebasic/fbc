'' By default, the jpeglib 9 API is used, but __JPEGLIB_VER__ can be #defined to 6,
'' 7, 8 or 9 to select a specific version, should that be necessary to match the
'' version of the libjpeg binary. Background: Due to changes to fields of the
'' jpeg_compress_struct and jpeg_decompress_struct structures, the different
'' jpeglib versions are ABI incompatible.

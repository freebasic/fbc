''   * This header file defines the interface that the SQLite library
''   * presents to client programs.  If a C-function, structure, datatype,
''   * or constant definition does not appear in this file, then it is
''   * not a published API of SQLite, is subject to change without
''   * notice, and should not be referenced by programs that use SQLite.
''   *
''   * Some of the definitions that are in this file are marked as
''   * "experimental".  Experimental interfaces are normally new
''   * features recently added to SQLite.  We do not anticipate changes
''   * to experimental interfaces but reserve the right to make minor changes
''   * if experience from use "in the wild" suggest such changes are prudent.
''   *
''   * The official C-language API documentation for SQLite is derived
''   * from comments in this file.  This file is the authoritative source
''   * on how SQLite interfaces are supposed to operate.
''   *
''   * The name of this file under configuration management is "sqlite.h.in".
''   * The makefile makes some minor changes to this file (such as inserting
''   * the version number) and changes its name to "sqlite3.h" as
''   * part of the build process.

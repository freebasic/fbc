Installing:

  fbhelp is a program for viewing an offline text version of the freebasic
  manual found at https://www.freebasic.net/wiki/DocToc using a custom format

  The help file to use is 'fbhelp.daz'

  fbhelp.daz can be found at:
      https://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc/files/Documentation/
      in the file "FB-manual-X.XX.X-fbhelp.zip" for the latest release
      of the fbc compiler.

  Put the following files in the same directory:

  o DOS version:

    - fbhelp.exe      ( help viewer for dos )
    - fbhelp.daz      ( the compressed help file )
    - fbhelp.txt      ( this file )

  o Windows version:

    - fbhelpw.exe     ( help viewer for windows )
    - fbhelp.daz      ( the compressed help file )
    - fbhelp.txt      ( this file )
    - zlib1.dll

  o Linux version:

    - fbhelp          ( help viewer for linux )
    - fbhelp.daz      ( the compressed help file )
    - fbhelp.txt      ( this file )


  fbhelp.daz may be uncompressed using the following commands:
    - rename fbhelp.daz fbhelp.dat.gz
    - gzip -d fbhelp.dat.gz 

  fbhelp.dat may be recompressed using the following commands:
    - gzip fbhelp.dat
    - rename fbhelp.dat.gz fbhelp.daz


Running & Usage:

  Run the executable fbhelp.exe, fbhelpw.exe, or ./fbhelp.

  Command line options:

      -bw                     black and white display only
      -blue                   use blue background
      -h -help                this help page
      -version                display version

  The command line options allow "/" or "-" as the prefix in the dos
  or windows version.

  The command line options must use "-" as the prefix in the linux 
  version.

  Both the dos version and the windows version will run in a dos window
  in older windows, otherwise, must use the windows version.

  Only the dos version will run under dos and requires CWSDMPI.EXE or
  other DPMI to be available.

  In dos, the starting size of the help viewer depends on the console.  
  Use the dos command "mode con lines=50" to get 80 x 50 mode, or
  similar utility to switch between 25 and 50 lines.

  In the dos version 8.3 format filenames are used unless the environment
  variable LFN=Y is set.

  The windows version may perform better than the dos version in a dos
  prompt window. (And does not require CWSDMPI.EXE)

  In windows the viewer will automatically size up to 80 x 50 characters.

  Linux currently uses a graphics window to emulate a 80 x 50 
  character console.

Compiling:

  o Requirements:
      - fbhelp sources ( https://github.com/freebasic/fbc/tree/master/doc/fbhelp )
      - if fbhelp sources are not available from the website, please contact
        Jeff Marshall ( coder[at]execulink[dot]com )
      - FreeBASIC version 1.0.0 or later ( https://www.freebasic.net/ )
      - zlib libraries ( http://www.zlib.net/ )

  o Making:

      make TARGET={target} [GFX=1]

      - where {target} is dos, linux, or win32
      - use GFX=1 to make the graphical version (640x480x8 only)
      - omit GFX=1 to make the console version

      Building for win 64-bit
      - make TARGET=win32 FBC="fbc-win64.exe -target win64"

      Building for DOS (under winXP)
      - due to the long file names build the DOS version using mingw32 to cross
        compile for DOS
      - make TARGET=dos FBC="fbc-win32.exe -target dos"

      Use fbdoc (the FreeBASIC document generator) to create fbhelp.dat

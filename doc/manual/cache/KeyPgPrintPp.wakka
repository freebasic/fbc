{{fbdoc item="desc"}}
	##**Print #**## outputs a list of values to a text file or device. Numeric values are converted to their string representation, with left padding for the sign. Objects of user-defined types must overload ##Operator Cast () As String##.
	
	Consecutive values in the expression list are separated either by a comma (##,##) or semicolon (##;##). A comma indicates printing should take place at the next 14 column boundary, while a semicolon indicates values are printed with no space between them.
	
	A new-line character is printed after the values in the expression list unless the expression list is followed by a comma or semicolon.
	
	Note that the comma (##,##) immediately following the file number is still necessary, even the expression list is empty.  In this case a new-line is printed, just as with a normal expression list that doesn't have a comma or semicolon at the end.

	- None, when using QBASIC's variable types in //[[CompilerOptlang|-lang qb]]//.
	- Unsigned numbers are printed without a space before them.
	- QB did not support casting for UDTs, so didn't allow them to be ##**Print**##ed.

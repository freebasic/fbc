	**2006 September - December**
		- Heavy changes in ""FreeBASIC"", neither "stable" nor "testing" releases

		- Introduction of the BFD library from the GNU binutils, providing additional link-time information in libraries.
	
	**2006 November** 
		- Started providing CVS versions of FB, Win and Linux, later also DOS
	
	**2006 December 08**
		- FBHELP "help viewer" 0.5 released, pretty mature now

	**2007 January - April**
		- Types (structures) allow member functions, operator overloading, properties, constructors and destructors. 
		- Graphics library has capabilities for screen control, events, and alpha blending. 
		- Built-in support for 64 bit file operations.

	**2007 May 2** 
		- The next 0.17 "testing" version, very much new. 
		- Shortly after this release, the version number in CVS was increased to 0.18, but before any full release of 0.17 had been made.

	**2007 May 14**
		- Version 0.17 released, similar to previous testing releases, but complete with installers.
		- Because the 0.17 sources can only be compiled with a version 0.16+2006-July-Testing combination, a release was made to allow users to install and compile ""FreeBASIC"" without applying any patch.
		- Major installation problems on the Linux release, so an additional Linux release was made a week later to correct the problems.
		- Some users found minor installation problems on DOS/Windows and workarounds made available.
		- First full release with graphics working (almost) with DOS target also
		- The major change in this full release compared to version 0.16, was that all procedure parameters now defaulted to passing BYVAL.

	**2007 June 7**
		- The ""FreeBASIC"" source code moved from CVS to SVN.   

	**2007 August 16**
		- ""FreeBASIC"" 0.18.1 full release uploaded.

		- many, many bug fixes
		- MILESTONE: PCOPY in text mode added ( dos/window only )

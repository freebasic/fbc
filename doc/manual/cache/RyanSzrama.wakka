I've been on the scene at least since high school (graduated in 2001), starting off at QB News and migrating to FreeBASIC as soon as was possible.  My personal site is currently http://www.bywombats.com, but I have yet to move my coding content over from my old site, http://www.geocities.com/szrrya.  My main contribution has been Red Jumpy Ball, though I authored Numbervold and The Hungry Jocke Game.  Numbervold took the prize in a QBE contest for text game, and back in the days of RPG-dev.net I nabbed the prize for Blackfurl, the start of a QB strategy RPG engine.  I'd love to go back to it, but...

My main programming now centers on PHP/MySQL for development of database driven web applications.  My current project is Ubercart, an e-commerce suite built on the Drupal CMS, found at http://www.ubercart.org.

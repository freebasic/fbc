I program things, and I am humbly awesome.  I use languages like ansi-c, freebasic, html, php, javascript and a bunch of other goodies to get to job done.  As always, the right tool can make a job pain free.

Some projects I'm working on/maintaining:
	- **FreeBASIC Chipmunk Port** "Chipmunk Physics library headers and binaries for freebasic.  A few demo programs, too.", [[http://code.google.com/p/chipmunk-freebasic/|Google Code Page]]

That is all,

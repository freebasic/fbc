======----{{anchor name="A"}} A----======

**access rights**
	The level of access associated with ##[[KeyPgType|Type]]## or ##[[KeyPgClass|Class]]## members. Public members are accessible to any code; protected members are accessible to member functions and any derived ##[[KeyPgType|Type]]## or ##[[KeyPgClass|Class]]## member functions; private members are accessible only to member functions of that ##[[KeyPgType|Type]]## or ##[[KeyPgClass|Class]]##. By default, ##[[KeyPgType|Type]]## members have public access rights, while ##[[KeyPgClass|Class]]## members are private.

**any pointer**
	A variable or expression that points to a memory address where it is not known, at least from the compiler's point of view, what type of data is stored at that address.  In C this would be the same as a void pointer or (void *).  See ##[[KeyPgPtr|ptr]]##.

**archive**
	An archive is a group or files or a single file packed into a container format and usually compressed before or afterward. Typical container formats are GNU Tar and Zip. Typical compression formats are Gzip and Zip.

**argument**
	Data that is passed to a procedure. The procedure refers to this data using the parameter(s) in its parameter list.

**argument passing convention**
	The method in which arguments are passed to procedures, being either ##[[KeyPgByref|by reference]]## or ##[[KeyPgByval|by value]]##.  See [[ProPgPassingArguments|Passing Arguments to Procedures]].

**array (container)**
	A collection of data whose elements are stored contiguously in memory (one after the other, in increasing order). Because of this, an array offers random-access to its elements (any element can be accessed at any time). Insertion or removal of elements anywhere but at the back of the container requires that those elements that follow be relocated, so a linked-list is typically preferred when insertion or removal needs to be efficient.

**assembler**
	A component in the tool chain for translating source code in to executable programs.  The assembler converts the low level assembly instruction mnemonics emitted by the compiler to object code.

**assignment**
	Assignment is one of the fundamental operations of computing.  All it means is copying a value into the memory location pointed at by a variable.  The value might be a literal, another variable, or the result of some expression. For an instance of a ##[[KeyPgType|Type]]## or ##[[KeyPgClass|Class]]##, this involves calling one of its assignment operators. Not to be confused with initialization.

**automatic storage**
	Refers to storage on the call stack. Local procedure variables, objects and arrays with automatic storage are allocated when the procedure is called, initialized when defined, destroyed (in the case of objects) when leaving the scope they're declared in and deallocated when returning from the procedure.

**automatic variable/object/array**
	A variable, object or array with **automatic storage**.

======----{{anchor name="B"}} B----======

**byref**
	##[[KeyPgByref|Byref]]## specifies passing arguments to procedures by reference. Arguments passed by reference can be modified by the procedure and the changes seen by the caller.

**byval**
	##[[KeyPgByref|Byval]]## specifies passing arguments to procedures by value. Procedures receive a copy of the argument passed. With ##[[KeyPgType|Type]]## or ##[[KeyPgClass|Class]]## instances, this involves instantiating temporary objects by calling their copy constructor. These temporaries are destroyed upon procedure exit.

**binaries**
	Binaries are the end result of source code. Binaries include executable files (.exe on windows), static library files (.a), dynamic library files (.dll on windows, .so on Linux), and relocatable object files. (.o)

**.BSS section**
	The part of the executable program that will contain zero bytes only when the program starts.  Since all of the bytes are zero, the final size of the executable can often be reduced by placing uninitialized data, or zero initialized data in this section.

**buffer**
	A region of memory that allows data to be saved or manipulated before being copied somewhere else.  In a communications device this may hold incoming or outgoing data yet to be processed.  In graphics, a buffer may contain an image before being copied to the screen.

**call back**
	A control mechanism where a caller lets a procedure call another procedure (the call back) provided by the caller typically through a function pointer.

**call stack**
	A chunk of memory reserved for a process or thread that is used as a stack for storing various information needed by procedures when they are called. Among the information stored on the call stack are all of the local automatic variables, objects and array data and usually whatever parameters are passed to the procedure. These items are allocated (//pushed// onto the call stack) when the procedure is called and deallocated (//popped// from the call stack) when the procedure returns, either by the caller or the callee, depending on the calling convention used. The initial and maximum sizes of this reserved memory vary by platform.

**caller**
	A misnomer used to refer to the point in code in which a procedure is called.

**cast**
	A cast operation changes one data type to another using specified rules. A ##[[KeyPgType|Type]]## structure can implement a custom ##[[KeyPgCast|Cast]]## for any intrinsic data type, and/or other TYPEs, See ##[[KeyPgCast|Cast]]##.

**code block**
	Several lines of source code grouped together all sharing at least one common scope.  For example a procedure's code block will be all the lines of code between ##[[KeyPgSub|Sub]]## and ##[[KeyPgEnd|End Sub]]##.

**com port**
	A short name for serial communications port.  A program can communicate with an external device, such as modem or another computer through a com port (nowadays the good old com ports are deprecated in favor of USB).  See ##[[KeyPgOpenCom|Open Com]]##.

**compiler**
	A compiler is a computer program which takes source code and transforms it into machine or object code.

**compiler directives**
	These are instructions included in the text of the program that affect the way the compiler behaves.  For instance the compiler might be directed to include one section of code or another of depending on the target operating system.

**compound statement**
	A statement composed one or more additional statements. Typically, a compound statement has a beginning (opening statement), a middle (a statement block) and an end (closing or ending statement), while some have additional parts. Examples of compound statements would be ##[[KeyPgIfthen|IF]]## and ##[[KeyPgFunction|FUNCTION]]##.

**constant**
	A symbol that retains a consistent value throughout the execution of the program. See ##[[KeyPgConst|Const]]##.

**constructor (module)**
	A special type of module-level procedure that is automatically called prior to the module-level code flow. See ##[[KeyPgModuleConstructor|Constructor (Module)]]##.

**constructor (TYPE or CLASS)**
	A special member function of a ##[[KeyPgType|Type]]## or ##[[KeyPgClass|Class]]## that is called when an object is instantiated.

**CVS**
	Concurrent Versions System. The file manager implemented at Sourceforge where sources are stored, it keeps the history of the changes introduced by the developers.  Used by FB in the past. (see also SVN and GIT)

**declaration**
	A source code statement that introduces a symbol, constant, variable, procedure, data type, or similar, to the compiler but not necessarily allocate any space for it.  See ##[[KeyPgDim|Dim]]##, ##[[KeyPgDeclare|Declare]]##, ##[[KeyPgExtern|Extern]]##, ##[[KeyPgType|Type]]##.

**definition**
	A source code statement (or statements) that allocates space for data or code.  For example, ##[[KeyPgSub|Sub]]## defines a procedure by allocating space for the program code it will contain.  Some statements can be both a declaration and a definition.  For example, ##[[KeyPgDim|Dim]]## both declares and defines a variable.

**linked list (container)**
	A collection of data whose elements are typically stored on the heap. The linked list's elements store the addresses of their adjacent elements, and so only sequential access (an element is accessed by following the links from adjacent elements) is possible. This scheme does provide constant-time insertion of elements anywhere into the container, however, and because of this is often preferred over the array.

**linker**
	A program which combines multiple modules and libraries into a single executable which can be loaded into the computer's memory and followed by the computer. ""FreeBASIC"" uses the **LD** linker. Linkers are the most common, but not the only way to produce executables.

**LGPL**

**local variable**
	A variable that is visible only within the scope in which it is declared, and that is destroyed when program execution leaves that scope.

**lock**
	A synchronization mechanism such that only one thread or process can have access to a shared object, for example a global variable, a device, or a file.

**method**
	See **member function**.

**module**
	A source file in its entirety, including any ##include files## that may be present as well. Typically, a module is a logical unit of code, containing parts of a program that relate to one another.

**non-static member data**
	Member data that each instance of a ##[[KeyPgType|Type]]## or ##[[KeyPgClass|Class]]## gets their own copy of.

**non-static member function**
	A **member function** that has an implicit ##[[KeyPgThis|This]]## reference as an argument.

**null**

**operator**
	A function taking one or more operands (arguments) and returning a value.  Operators can work on built-in data types, or can be overloaded to work on user defined types.  See ##[[CatPgOperators|Operators]]##.

**overload**
	To declare a procedure having the same name as another, but with different parameters. Free functions, or module-level functions, can be overloaded using the ##[[KeyPgOverload|Overload]]## keyword. ##[[KeyPgType|Type]]## or ##[[KeyPgClass|Class]]## member functions can be overloaded by default.

**page buffer**
	A buffer used for holding the contents of the screen before being displayed on screen.  Where multiple page buffers are allowed, one page will be visible to the users while all others are hidden.  Also the active page (the one to which changes are made) need not be the visible one allowing changes to one page while showing another.

**parameter**
	The name used by a procedure that corresponds to the argument that is passed to it.

**parameter list**
	The parenthesized comma-separated list of parameters in a procedure declaration or definition.

**PDS**
	Professional Development System.  Sometimes referred to as QB7.1.

**pitch**
	The number of bytes per row, in an image or screen buffer.  If there is no padding between rows, then this can be calculated by ##width * bytes_per_pixel##, but this is not necessarily safe to assume.  The screen's pitch can be found using ##[[KeyPgScreeninfo|Screeninfo]]##, and an image buffer's pitch can be found by checking the ##pitch## value in the image's header.

**scope**
	Refers to the life-time and visibility of some component of the program, like a variable or a procedure.  For example, a variable defined inside a procedure would have procedure scope: it is visible throughout the procedure, but not outside the procedure's code block.  When the procedure ends, the variable goes out of scope and no longer exists.

**scope block**
	A code block where all the lines of source have the same scope.  An explicit scope block can be indicated with the ##[[KeyPgScope|Scope]]## statement.  Scope blocks may also be implicit with the usage of ##[[KeyPgIfthen|If..Then]]##, ##[[KeyPgFornext|For..Next]]##, and other compound statements.

**shared library**
	A library that exists once on a system that multiple executables can link to at runtime. See ##[[ProPgSharedLibraries|Shared Libraries (DLLs)]]##.

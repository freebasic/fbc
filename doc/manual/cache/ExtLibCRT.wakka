{{fbdoc item="title" value="CRT, the C Runtime Library"}}----
Standard C language functions. On Windows, this is implemented in msvcrt.dll (however, there also are version-specific msvcrXX.dlls, the ""Microsoft Visual C++"" runtimes). On Linux, the C runtime is typically implemented by glibc. For DOS, ""FreeBASIC"" uses DJGPP, which provides a libc library.

GD is a graphics library for dynamically manipulating images. It can create GIFs, JPEGs, PNGs, and WBMPs. 

GD can create images composed of lines, arcs, text (using program-selected fonts), other images, and multiple colors. Version 2.0 adds support for truecolor images, alpha channels, resampling (for smooth resizing of truecolor images), and many other features.

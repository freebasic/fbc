Statement for sequenced pixel plotting

{{fbdoc item="syntax"}}##
	**Draw** [//target//,] //cmd//
##
{{fbdoc item="param"}}
	##//target//##
		the buffer to draw on
	##//cmd//##
		a string containing the sequence of commands

{{fbdoc item="desc"}}
	Drawing will take place onto the current work page set via ##[[KeyPgScreenset|ScreenSet]]## or onto the ##//target//## ##[[KeyPgGetgraphics|Get]]##/##[[KeyPgPutgraphics|Put]]## buffer if specified.
	The ##**Draw**## statement can be used to issue several drawing commands all at once; it is useful to quickly draw figures. The command string accepts the following commands:

	Commands to plot pixels:
	{{table columns="2" cellpadding="1" cells="Command;Description;###;Commands to plot pixels:;B;Optional prefix: move but do not draw.;N;Optional prefix: draw but do not move.;M x,y;Move to specified screen location. if a '+' or '-' sign precedes x, movement is relative to current cursor position.  x's sign has no effect on the sign of y.;U [n];Move n units up. If n is omitted, 1 is assumed.;D [n];Move n units down. If n is omitted, 1 is assumed.;L [n];Move n units left. If n is omitted, 1 is assumed.;R [n];Move n units right. If n is omitted, 1 is assumed.;E [n];Move n units up and right. If n is omitted, 1 is assumed.;F [n];Move n units down and right. If n is omitted, 1 is assumed.;G [n];Move n units down and left. If n is omitted, 1 is assumed.;H [n];Move n units up and left. If n is omitted, 1 is assumed.;###;Commands to color:;C n;Changes current foreground color to n.;P p,b;PAINTs (flood fills) region of border color b with color p.;###;Commands to scale and rotate:;S n;Sets the current unit length, default is 4.  A unit length of 4 is equal to 1 pixel.;A n;Rotate n*90 degrees (n ranges 0-3).;TA n;Rotate n degrees (n ranges 0-359).;###;Extra commands:;X p;Executes commands at p, where p is a STRING PTR."}}
	
Commands to set the color, size and angle will take affect all subsequent ##**Draw**## operations.

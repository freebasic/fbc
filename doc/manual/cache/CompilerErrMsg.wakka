{{fbdoc item="title" value="Compiler Error Messages"}}----
During the program compilation three types of errors can arise:

==Compiler Warnings:==
	The warnings don't stop the compilation, just alert the user some non-recommended and error-prone operation is attempted in the code. 
	Sometimes one of these operations is coded deliberately to achieve a result, in this case the warnings can be disabled by setting  the //[[CompilerOptw|-w 1]]// option at the command line.

	- //1 Passing scalar as pointer//
	- //2 Passing pointer to scalar//
	- //3 Passing different pointer types//
	- //4 Suspicious pointer assignment//
	- //5 Implicit conversion//
	- //6 Cannot export symbol without -export option//
	- //7 Identifier's name too big, truncated//
	- //8 Literal number too big, truncated//
	- //9 Literal string too big, truncated//
	- //10 UDT with pointer or var-len string fields//
	- //11 Implicit variable allocation//
	- //12 Missing closing quote in literal string//
	- //13 Function result was not explicitly set//
	- //14 Branch crossing local variable definition//
	- //15 No explicit BYREF or BYVAL//
	- //16 Possible escape sequence found in//
	- //17 The type length is too large, consider passing BYREF//
	- //18 The length of the parameters list is too large, consider passing UDT's BYREF//
	- //19 The ANY initializer has no effect on UDT's with default constructors//
	- //20 Object files or libraries with mixed multithreading (-mt) options//
	- //21 Object files or libraries with mixed language (-lang) options//
	- //22 Deleting ANY pointers is undefined//
	- //23 Array too large for stack, consider making it var-len or SHARED//
	- //24 Variable too large for stack, consider making it SHARED//
	- //25 Overflow in constant conversion//
	- //26 Variable following NEXT is meaningless//
	- //27 Cast to non-pointer//
	- //28 Return method mismatch//
	- //29 Passing Pointer//
	- //30 Command line option overrides directive//
	- //31 Directive ignored after first pass//
	- //32 'IF' statement found directly after multi-line 'ELSE'//
	- //33 Shift value greater than or equal to number of bits in data type//
	- //34 '=' parsed as equality operator in function argument, not assignment to BYREF function result//
	- //35 Mixing signed/unsigned operands//
	- //36 Mismatching parameter initializer//
	- //37 //
	- //38 Mixing operand data types may have undefined results//
	- //39 Redefinition of intrinsic//

==Compiler Error messages:==
	The error messages stop the compilation after 10 errors (see the -maxerr command-line option to change that default value) or a fatal error occurred, and require a correction by the user before the compilation can be continued. The compiler signals the lines where the errors have been found, so the correction can be done quickly. In a few cases the place pointed at by the error messages is not where the errors can be found, it's the place where the compiler has given up in waiting for something that should be somewhere.

==Third party programs errors==
	These errors occur after the source has been compiled into assembler, they come from the auxiliary programs FB requires to compile a source into an executable: the linker, the assembler and (for Windows programs) the resource compiler.

	If an IDE or a make utility are been used, additional errors can arise. These errors are outside the scope of this help.

	Constants are numbers which cannot be changed after they are defined. For example, 5 will always mean the same number.
	
	In FreeBASIC, a constant definition differs from a variable definition by usage of the ##[[KeyPgConst|Const]]## command.

	Such constants are then available globally, meaning that once defined, you can use the word to refer to a constant anywhere in your program. 

	After being defined with the ##[[KeyPgConst|Const]]## command, constants cannot be altered. If code tries to alter a constant, an error message will result upon code compilation.

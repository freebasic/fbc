Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a library that creates an abstraction over various platforms' graphics, sound, and input APIs, allowing a developer to write a computer game or other multimedia application once and run it on GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS Classic, Mac OS X, BeOS and a few other unofficially ported platforms. It manages video, events, numeric audio, CD-ROM sound, threads, and timers.

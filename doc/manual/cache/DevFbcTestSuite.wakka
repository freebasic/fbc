{{fbdoc item="title" value="Compiling the test suite"}}----

The ""FreeBASIC"" project has a suite of tests which ensure that bugs stay dead and that new bugs have a harder time of gaining a foothold.

{{fbdoc item="section" value="Compiling and getting Test Results"}}
The tests are located in the ##tests## subdirectory within the main ""FreeBASIC"" directory.  The following two commands will compile and run all the tests:
%%
$ make unit-tests
   generates fbc-tests[.exe]

$ make log-tests
   generates failed-test-fb.log
   generates failed-test-qb.log
   generates failed-test-deprecated.log
   if all tests passed, the log file reports "None found"
%%

Initial generation of index files will take place, followed by the compilation of hundreds of tests. Be patient, it can take a while to run all of the tests...

Invoking with make will present the following help text:

{{fbdoc item="section" value="Reporting Test Failures"}}

If everything is working as it should, there should be no failures.  If there is a failure, then it could indicate a problem with the compiler, or a particular build target.  If you get failures, please consider reporting on https://www.freebasic.net/forum so others can investigate.

Thank you for running the tests and contributing to make ""FreeBASIC"" a healthy compiler!

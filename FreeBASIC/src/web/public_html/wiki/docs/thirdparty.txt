Third-party software bundled with Wikka
=======================================

Wikka bundles a number of third-party packages to provide some of its
functionality. All these open-source packages are either released under
GPL (GNU General Public License) or a compatible Open Source license.

In order to keep Wikka's installed footprint small, as well as limit the
download size, some files in the original third-party package - such as
large documentation files - may not have been included. For normal
operation of Wikka these files aren't needed since Wikka already provides
the integration. In addition, you may already have some of these available
on your system, so this eliminates some needless duplication. Should you
want to modify Wikka, or the way it integrates with a third-party package,
you may need the full documentation though; the overview of Wikka's
third-party packages (below) provides you with the information you need to
download the full package or contact the author. The software is written
in PHP unless indicated otherwise.

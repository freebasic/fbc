Version 0.18.1 Beta:

[changed]
- the default calling convention of variables has changed in -lang FB. UDT's (including strings) will default to BYREF, all else will default to BYVAL (cha0s)
- TYPEs with default constructor/destructors or methods had to be allowed on the module level. This affects you if you define a TYPE inside a function with any functions inside the TYPE, or any child objects that have constructors or destructors. This includes elements 'as string', since they need constructors and destructors to initialize and clean up memory (cha0s)
- ODE 0.8 headers, import library, and examples, thanks D.J.Peters, (jeffm)

[added]
- configure option for --disable-objinfo to allow building and using fbc with a broader range of binutils (jeffm)
- A third parameter to ThreadCreate, you can specify the size of the thread's stack, in bytes (cha0s)
- inc/image_compat.bi, to abstract some of the issues between new/old image formats (cha0s)

[fixed]
- #1735413 - UDT initialization would fail if the initialization expression was surrounded in parenthesis, due to the udt = (elm, elm) syntax. it will now fallback to check if the first expression encountered matches the udt type, if so, it will attempt a ctor call/assign. (cha0s)
- #1734192 - UDT initialization with unions should have been checking the first union element against the given expresssion. (cha0s)
- Mangling params taking FB arrays wasn't unique from params as the array's datatype. Recompile any libraries/linked objects taking arrays as parameters.
- ThreadCreate was accepting literally "any" pointer at its first parameter. Added a mechanism for building function pointer symbols (to check against, say the first arg passed to ThreadCreate) at the rtl symbol initializer. (cha0s)
- #1713886 - symbols in FOR had the temp bit stripped out to make scope jumping work, but it can be added in later, otherwise the branch checker will get confused (cha0s)
- #1696229(part one!) - constant symbols in TYPEs could be modified with disastrous results. (cha0s)

[changed]
- include file and import library for libcurl 7.15.4 (jeffm)
- #1723533 - MK* had to be reverted, it will not evaluate constant numeric expressions to constant literal expressions anymore (it will behave like it used to), because of the NULL-terminated nature of literal strings, sorry (CV* still evaluates to constants(arguably much more important ;)) (cha0s)
- the overload resolution wasn't normalizing the total sum of its matching args (cha0s)

  IMPORTANT: this is a binary incompatible change - you must recompile any code that uses SETMOUSE or GETMOUSE (DrV)
- a vararg procedure can now be defined in a TYPE, it has to be unique (cha0s)

Version 0.14 Beta:

[changed]
- IMPORTANT: to fully support pointer type-casting, now every time a pointer is updated, the expression will be

  must be changed to "p += 1"
- to make BYVAL AS STRING arguments more safe, as they are allowed in FB functions since version 0.13, if not
  passing pointers or numeric values such as NULL or 0, the BYVAL modifier will have to be used now (v1c)

  objects files, the -m command-line option must be used to tell the compiler which module will be the main
  one (v1c)

  such will be missed as it used to happen in QB. Implicit module initialization can be done now as in Pascal,
  just add any code to the module-level scope (ie: outside any function) (v1c)

[fixed]
- IMPORTANT: fixed a bug with horizontal/vertical styled LINE drawing; this means the GfxPrint routine as was reported

- unsigned versions for READ were missing (v1c)
- field arrays starting at offset 0 with a lbound <> 0 would cause an access to the wrong fields, 'cause a bug at parser3 (v1c)
- escape seqs generated by chr$ when evaluated at compile-time would fail if an octagonal escape was needed and other numbers followed (v1c)
- some fixes to the way gfx coordinates are transformed when WINDOW is active (lillo)

Version 0.12 Beta:

[changed]
- IMPORTANT: now to declare functions on DLL's that will be exported, the EXPORT clause must be used, as global
  functions won't be automatically exported anymore, because that would make it hard to write DLL's with
  multiple modules where not all global functions should be exported (v1ctor)
- IMPORTANT: the format of the internal string descriptor was modified to speed up concatenation of large strings,
  so you MUST recompile all the old code, don't reuse object files compiled with older versions (below v0.12b) and
  rebuild DLL's created in FB if they return or process STRING's passed to/from client EXE's (v1c)
- Linux port does not use ncurses anymore, but its own internal lowlevel routines for console access.
  Apart from no ncurses dependency, this means faster console output (also under X11), no screen clearing
  at programs startup and proper colors support under X11. Compatibility issues may rise though, so
  feedback is welcome (lillo)
- PEEKS, PEEKI, POKES, POKEI keywords removed, use now the new syntax as "PEEK( data type, expression )" or
  "POKE data ype, expression, expression" to peek/poke different data types than BYTE, that's the default one (v1c)
- many Allegro's globals like al_screen, al_rgb had the "al_" prefix removed, they are now as the originals (v1c)

- generated EXEs size can now be up to 5-6K smaller than before (lillo)
- empty statements like ":foo=1::bar=2:" are now accepted, "if foo then:bar:else:foo" will work too (v1c)
- DIM|REDIM array w/o explicit dimensions is not allowed anymore inside procs, as the descriptor size is unknown (v1c)
- RGB is now an intrinsic macro, not a function (so no UDT's called RGB are allowed anymore) (v1c)
- symbols can now start with an underscore as in "_1234 = 1234" (v1c)
- local labels can now have the same name in different procs (v1c)

[added]
- resource files support on Windows, just add the .rc's or .res' to the list, they will be automatically
  compiled -- the Windows C headers were also added, so complex scripts (ie: dialogs and menus) can be
  used too (DrV)
- XPM icon resource files support on Linux. As with Windows resource, just pass the .xpm file to
  the commandline and the executable will sport a fb_program_icon symbol holding the XPM data.
  If using gfxlib, this is automatically used to set the window icon (lillo)
- built-in multiplatform threading functions (lillo)
- "operator =" shorthand, as in "a += b * c" (v1ctor)

- d! = cbyte( d! ) would gen bad code at EMIT if the SI or DI registers were used as source (v1c)
- #define's would be checked inside $include and $inclib if ' was used as delimiter (v1c)


Version 0.11 Beta:

[changed]
- the internal GFX library is now the former alternative one written by lillo, many thanks to Sterling
  for making the first version, he started working on it even before FB was released -- if you prefer to
  continue using it, the sources still on CVS at sf.net (src/gfxlib), just build the library and rewrite
  the libfbgfx.a file at \lib, it contains no PAINT or DRAW, nor low-res screen modes, but everything
  else stills functional - the SCREEN arguments are different, pay attention
- new OpenGL header translated by Rel to work better with pointers, there are no more BYREF arguments,
  use @ or varptr() to get the address of variables and arrays when the argument is a BYVAL ... PTR (v1c)
- fmod and BASS headers: all BYREF arguments changed to BYVAL ... PTR to work better with pointers (v1c)
- new SDL headers translated by Edmond Leung, no changes needed on user's code (v1c)

- ERASE now accepts non-dynamic arrays and fills them with 0's (v1c)
- the crt dll on Win32 is now msvcrt.dll instead of crtdll.dll, to be able to statically link to libs
  compiled with VC 5/6 and Mingw (crtdll is not supported by M$ anymore), you can use the new -nostdlibs
  option to set a different lib (like crtdll) if you really need that -- ie: plain vanilla Windows 95/osr2
  doesn't come with msvcrt.dll installed (it can be found at M$'s site) (v1c)

- line continuation char "_" was being processed inside comments and $include's file names (v1c)
- entry point name wasn't checking for "-" chars, that are valid on file names, but invalid on symbol names (v1c)
- using RESTORE w/o a label before any DATA statement would create the wrong default label (v1c)
- loading larger vars to byte ones with SI/DI was wrong as the source type was not being remapped at EMIT (v1c)


Version 0.03 Beta:

[fixed]
- entry point name was wrong when the source file had slashes in the name, and not back-slashes (v1ctor)
- IR was renaming the compare ops when operands hadn't the same class, 'cause a x86 FPU opt. done at AST (v1c)


Version 0.02 Beta:

[fixed]
- IR module was not freeing regs of the same classes while making int convertions and reusing them (v1ctor)
- optargs.bas wasn't working, it was being used just as a prototype, shouldn't be there (v1c)
- argument-less function pointers: parser wasn't accepting them when ()'s were used (v1c)
- right$ was reversing the result (v1c)

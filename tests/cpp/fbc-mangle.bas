	/' !!!
		cxxlongint will currently fail on win64, fbc custom mangles INTEGER and there is 
		no other data type that will return the "m" and "l" suffixes for c's long int.
		The specific test that fails is skipped over using and and #ifdef.  To have a basic
		datatype on win64 that can map to g++ long int, one possible solution would be
		change the overloading allowed for the c++ mangled names onlym what would have to
		be added to fbc.

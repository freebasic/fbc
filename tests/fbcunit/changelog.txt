Version 0.5

[changed]
- License is GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1 (or later) plus linking exception -- see license.txt


Version 0.4

[added]
- explicit copyright notices on source files and in the readme.txt

Version 0.3

[added]
- CU_ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQUAL() macro added - it is needed for fbc compiler test suite
- fbcu.check_internal_state() performs checks on the internal data
- console print logger calls crt fprintf directly - using fbc's OPEN in the library can interfere with unit tests

[changed]
- run_tests() now takes a verbose parameter
- run_tests() returns true=success, false=fail
- run_tests() checks return values from SUITE_INIT and SUITE_CLEANUP and reports failures
- CU_ASSERT_() now takes boolean data type as value argument (was long)

[fixed]
- hash table look up for suite names was failing when index was 0 (zero)
- CU_PASS() definition was incorrect
- CU_FAIL() definition was incorrect
- CU_ASSERT_TRUE() was comparing "=true" and needs to compare "<>false"


Version 0.2

[added]
- dual api for using fbcunit in -lang qb
- internal: use a singly linked lists to run tests for each test
- internal: use a hash for suite name lookups
- SUITE_INIT & SUITE_EXIT macros

[changed]
- fbcunit.bi reorganized to separate helper macros and code emitters

[fixed]
- find_suite() has always returning INVALID_INDEX
- unable to append tests to existing suite due to duplicate constructor names
- make constructors private to avoid name collisions
- lang qb: fix pseudo namespace "tests"

fbcunit TODO/BUG list:

[ ] write a (short) manual on the library's API

[ ] add unit tests (for fbcunit itself) for all CU_* macros

[ ] for compatibility with existing fbc compiler suite,
	can't check the return value of init & cleanup code
	because fbc test suite doesn't set it.

	1) remove the check, and let user decide how to deal with
		failed init & cleanup code - i.e. CU_ASSERT_FATAL( false )

	OR 2) default to success and let user set a FAIL flag

	OR 3) update fbc test suites

	For either #2 or #3 still todo:
	SUITE_INIT and SUITE_CLEANUP need to set the function 
	return value.  Consider	adding a macro to set the value.

	Current	work around for qb is:

	SUITE( somename )
		SUITE_INIT
			somename.init = true
		END_SUITE_INIT
		SUITE_CLEANUP
			somename.cleanup = true
		END_SUITE_CLEANUP
	END_SUITE


	Current	work around for fb, fblite is:

	SUITE( somename )
		SUITE_INIT
			function = true
		END_SUITE_INIT
		SUITE_CLEANUP
			function = true
		END_SUITE_CLEANUP
	END_SUITE

[X] add alternate console logger - when used with 
	fbc compiler test suite, fbcunit's PRINT doesn't
	write to console after graphics tests

[X] handle success/failure of suite init & cleanup procs
	if the init proc fails, shouldn't run the tests for that
	suite.

[X] add exit code for run_tests to determine success
	or failure

[X] add a verbose mode selector - when used with
	fbc compiler test suite, it is really just too much
	printed for regular runs.

[X] group the tests by suite before running the list
	of tests.  Currently the sequence is by test then
	by suite creating NxM comparisons.

[X] create a hash look-up or similar for find_suite()
	find_suite is needed because possible that the
	same suite could be defined across multiple
	source modules.  currently is a trivial sequential
	scan and won't scale well.

[X] qb doesn't support namespaces and many other 
    keywords so need a wrapper api for the lang qb mode

[X] fix the of adding tests to the default suite
	see tests/fbcu_global.bas and then compare
	to the output when running tests/tests.exe
	The global suite index is not set correctly
	or is set at the wrong time -- a bug

[X] add SUITE_INIT and SUITE_CLEANUP macros to allow
	creating a proc for code that needs to run at
	beginning and end of a suite at run-time.

		SUITE( fbcu )
			SUITE_INIT
				'' start-up code
			END_SUITE_INIT
			SUITE_CLEANUP
				'' clean-up code
			END_SUITE_CLEANUP

			TEST( first )
			END_TEST

			... etc
		END_SUITE

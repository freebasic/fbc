	 * separator used by float <-> string conversion functions.
	 * Users should call setlocale() manually if they want localisation.

	 * Don't bother doing it under DJGPP - there we don't really support
	 * wstrings anyways, and the setlocale() reference increases .exe size.

	/* Doing clean-up here in the rtlib's global dtor, instead of using
	   atexit().

	   FB supports global ctors/dtors, and thus FB programs can call FB
	   functions from there. Hence the rtlib/gfxlib2 initialization should
	   be the first global ctor, and the clean-up should be the last global
	   dtor. This is done by fbrt0.c. We can't rely on atexit() for this,
	   because sometimes the atexit handlers can be called before the global
	   dtors, sometimes after.

	   However, on Windows it's not safe to do certain things such as
	   waiting for a thread to finish from inside a global
	   constructor/destructor due to the loader lock. (A lock is acquired
	   to synchronize calls to DllMain() etc., so waiting for a thread from
	   inside a global destructor may cause a dead-lock, as that thread
	   needs to acquire the same lock to be able to exit.) Because of this,
	   gfxlib2 clean-up can't be done during a global dtor, at least not on
	   Windows, because its win32 backends use a background thread. So the
	   gfxlib clean-up must be done during fb_End() instead.

	   Some observations about atexit() behaviour: it depends on context,
	   e.g. whether it's called from a global ctor or global dtor or main(),
	   or whether it's a shared lib/DLL or executable,
	   and it depends on the platform (e.g. GNU/Linux vs MinGW-w64).
	   Thus it can't be used reliably. */

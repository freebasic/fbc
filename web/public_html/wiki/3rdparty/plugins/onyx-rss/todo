1.) Support element attributes.  I know HOW to do it, I just
    cannot think of a logical way to store them in an array.
    PLEASE let me know if you have an good ideas on this.

2.) Make a general set function for variables that can replace
    the four set functions.  This function should take an array
    or the variables seperately.

3.) Feed validation option prior to parsing.

4.) Seperate into 2 (or more) classes, at least one for a XML
    wrapper, and another for the RSS functions.

' This example uses ProcPtr to demonstrate function pointers
Declare Function Subtract( x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer
Declare Function Add( x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer
Dim myFunction As Function( x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer

' myFunction will now be assigned to Add
myFunction = ProcPtr( Add )
Print myFunction(2, 3)

' myFunction will now be assigned to Subtract.  Notice the different output.
myFunction = ProcPtr( Subtract )
Print myFunction(2, 3)

Function Add( x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer
	Return x + y
End Function

Function Subtract( x As Integer, y As Integer) As Integer
	Return x - y
End Function

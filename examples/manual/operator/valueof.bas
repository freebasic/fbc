'This program demonstrates the use of * to utilize the value a pointer points to.
Dim a As Integer
Dim pa As Integer Ptr

pa=@a 'Here, we use the @ operator to point our integer ptr at 'a'.
' 'a' is, in this case, a standard integer variable.

a=9     'Here we give 'a' a value of 9.

Print "The value of 'a' is";*pa 'Here, we display the value of 'a' using a pointer. 

*pa = 1 'Here we use our pointer to change the value of 'a'
Print "The new value of 'a' is";a 'Here we display the new value of 'a'.

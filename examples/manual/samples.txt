About the Samples
-----------------

These sources have been extracted for the primary purpose of compile
checking all of the manual's example code.  So while most of the examples 
are probably useful, not all of them will be.  Some examples are only one or 
two lines of code that don't have any real usefulness outside of the manual
itself.


Builing the Sample Builder:
---------------------------

First, use fbc to compile the sample builder

    fbc samples.bas


Making the Samples:
-------------------

Next, run 'samples' to build the samples.

    samples compile


To see more options on how to build the samples including
specifying the compiler to use, which directories to build, and
where the source directory is located, run 'samples' without any
command line arguments.

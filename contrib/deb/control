Description: Compiler for the FreeBASIC programming language
 The FreeBASIC project is a set of cross-platform development tools initially
 created by Andre Victor, consisting of a compiler, GNU-based assembler,
 linker and archiver, and supporting runtime libraries, including a
 software-based graphics library. The compiler, fbc, currently supports
 building for i386-based architectures on the DOS, Linux, Windows and Xbox
 platforms. The project also contains thin bindings (header files) to some
 popular 3rd party libraries such as the C runtime library, Allegro, SDL,
 OpenGL, GTK, the Windows API and many others, as well as example programs
 for many of these libraries.
 .
 FreeBASIC is a high-level programming language supporting procedural,
 object-oriented and meta-programming paradigms, with a syntax compatible to
 Microsoft QuickBasic. In fact, the FreeBASIC project originally began as an
 attempt to create a code-compatible, free alternative to Microsoft QuickBasic,
 but it has since grown into a powerful development tool. FreeBASIC can be seen
 to extend the capabilities of Microsoft QuickBasic in a number of ways,
 supporting more data types, language constructs, programming styles, and
 modern platforms and APIs.
